# Data Science
# Readme

This is a repository to hold Data Science related scripts. These are Python scripts that mainly use numpy, matplotlib, Seaborn and other popular packages that are used in Data Science. These scripts should act as reference or to document my work when working on Data Science related tasks/projects.
